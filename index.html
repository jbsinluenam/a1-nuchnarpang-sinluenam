    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Hi! My name is Nuchnarpang, but you can call me JB. I just arrived at
      Vancouver last month, and I think I'm starting to
      <strong>love</strong> the city. Although I have not experienced
      <em>Raincouver</em> yet. But I'm confident I'm gonna love it too.
      <em>Come rain! Come shine!</em>

    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>

    <h3>Reading Books</h3>
    <h4>Why I like reading books</h4>
    <p>
      The right book takes you to the place where no vehicle can take you. It
      makes you warm, and it can make you chill. It can be your best friend when
      you have no one to talk too.

    <h3>Taking On A Road Trip</h3>
    <h4>Why I like road trip</h4>
    <p>
      Nothing says relaxation best than a road trip with the beautiful mountains
      around you. I find it clears my mind best and lots of time gives me a new
      perspective of life. Also it's a wonderful oppotunity to bond with your
      friend and family.
